useEffect(fn, [a,b,c]):
    Effect will synchronized with a,b and c.
    runs on mount and rerenders triggered by updating a,b or c

useEffect(fn, []):
    Effect will synchronized with no states or props.
    run only on mount(at initial render)
    因为dependency是空的array，所以这个Effect不会收到re-render的影响，只会在第一次render时被运行

useEffect(fn):
    Effect will synchronized on everything.
    run on every render, which is bad



useRef():
    is mutable, current property that is presisted across renders, 也就意味着即使application重新render，useRef的内容也不会改变
    Two big usecases:
        1. Creating a variable that stays the same between renders
        2. select DOM element
    Refs are for data that is not rendered, usually only appear in event handlers or effect, not in JSX(use useState otherwise)
    Not allowed to read or write in the render logic
